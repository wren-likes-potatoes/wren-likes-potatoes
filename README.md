- 👋 Hi, I’m @wren-likes-potatoes. My name is Wren. Potato is also acceptable.
- 👀 I’m interested in potatoes and programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming and knitting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment unless you're offering cookies to do it
- 📫 How to reach me send a carrier pigeon with a message into the mysterious woods behind the McDonalds. It should reach me in 3-5 business weeks.
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them (he/him is also okay)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an intense hatred of circles! (I'm a geometry student)
